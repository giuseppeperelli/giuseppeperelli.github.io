Welcome to my Website! I am an **Associate Professor** at [Dipartimento di Informatica](http://www.di.uniroma1.it/), Universit&agrave; di Roma, La Sapienza.

My [research interests](/research) regard many aspects of **Formal Methods for Artificial Intelligence**. In particular, I work on verification and synthesis for multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, strategic reasoning, logics, games, and automata theory.

##### Awards
In 2025, I received a Special Mention for [Best Young Researcher Award in Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/italian-chapter-awards/) from [IC-EATCS](https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/italian-chapter).

In 2023, I received the **["Marco Somalvico" Young Researcher Award](https://aixia.it/premi/premio-intelligenza-artificiale-marco-somalvico-biennale/)** from the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence as best Young Italian researchers who autonomously contributed to advance the state-of-the-art in the field.

In 2012, I received the **[3+2 Award](https://www.ailalogica.it/pdf/premi/relazione3+2-2012.pdf)** from the Italian Association for Logics and its Applications, for Best Master Thesis in Logics.
