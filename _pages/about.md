<!--<img src="assets/img/di-inline-transparent.png" class="logo"  alt="logo of Sapienza University">-->

I am <em>Assistant Professor</em> ([RTD-B](https://academicpositions.com/career-advice/italian-academic-job-titles)) at [Dipartimento di Informatica](http://www.di.uniroma1.it/), Universit&agrave; di Roma, La Sapienza.

My research interests regard many aspects of Formal Methods for Artificial Intelligence. In particular, I work on verification and synthesis for multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, strategic reasoning, logics, games, and automata theory.
In 2023, I received the ["Marco Somalvico" Young Researcher Award](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/it/notizie/riconoscimenti/premio-marco-somalvico-giuseppe-perelli) from the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence as best under 37 Italian researchers who autonomously contributed to advance the state-of-the-art in the field.
In 2012, I received the 3+2 Award from the Italian Association for Logics and its Applications, for Best Master Thesis in Logics.

#### Research

###### Logic and Automata
During my PhD, I focused on the study of Logics for the Verification and Synthesis of strategic behavior in multi-agent systems. In particular, I gave my decisive contribution to the development of Strategy Logic: a language now widely applied in AI and formal methods to reason about strategies and actions in multi-agent systems.

###### Rational Synthesis
During my years as a research associate at the University of Oxford, University of Leicester, and Chalmers University, my main focus was on Rational Verification and Synthesis, concerning the synthesis of equilibria for games that are used as a modelling tool for multi-agent interacting scenarios, such as autonomous-driving cars, automated wharehouse, and the like. I have contributed to the development of [EVE](http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk/): a formal verification tool for the automated analysis of temporal equilibrium properties of concurrent and multi-agent systems.

###### Finite Trace
I focused on defining and solving synthesis variants of finite temporal specifications. The problem has direct applications in the areas of planning, business process management, as well as robotics, where agents tasks are assumed to be of finite duration.

###### Normative Systems
My recent focus has been on Normative Systems, concerning the problem of regulating MAS by means of norms and other formally defined machineries, employed to guarantee correct-by-construction behaviour of systems from a global/designer point of view.

#### Available Theses

<span style="color:red">I am open to supervise Bs and Ms Theses</span>. These can be oriented towards surveys (for Bs), implementations (for Bs and Ms), or research problems (mostly Ms but also Bs). The topics cover several areas of AI, Formal Methods, and Multi-Agent Systems, including:

- **Automated Reasoning**, including logics representation and reasoning about strategies.
- **Verification, Synthesis and Rational Synthesis**, including single and multi-agent systems.
- **Linear-Time Temporal Logics**, including automata-theoretic and game-theoretic approach in Formal Verification.
- **Normative Systems**, including mechanism and multi-agent system design.

<!--##### Short Bio

From March 2012 to February 2015, I have been <em>PhD student</em> at [University of Naples "Federico II"](http://www.unina.it) working under the supervision of [Prof. Aniello Murano](http://people.na.infn.it/~murano/).
During my PhD, I have been visiting research scholar at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Moshe Vardi](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi).
On April 2015, I joined [University of Oxford](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) as <em>Postdoctoral Research Assistant</em>, working with [Prof. Michael Wooldridge](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/) on his Advanced ERC project [RACE](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/RACE/index.html).
On July 2018, I moved to [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/) and then, in June 2019, [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/)&nbsp;/ [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/) to work with [Prof. Nir Piterman](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~piterman/) as <em>Research Associate</em> on his Consolidator ERC project [dSynMA](https://dsynmaerc.bitbucket.io/).
From January 2020 to November 2021, I have been at [Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Automatica e Gestionale](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/) at Universit&agrave; di Roma, La Sapienza as <em>Research Associate</em>, working with [Prof. Giuseppe de Giacomo](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/degiacom/) on his Advanced ERC project [WhiteMech](https://whitemech.github.io/).-->
