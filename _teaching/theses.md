> There is nothing more practical than a good theory. (Kurt Lewin)


I am open to supervise Ms Theses. These can be oriented towards surveys, implementations, or research problems.

### Available Theses

The topics cover several areas of AI, Formal Methods, and Multi-Agent Systems, including:

- **Automated Reasoning**, including logics representation and reasoning about strategies.
- **Verification, Synthesis and Rational Synthesis**, including single and multi-agent systems.
- **Linear-Time Temporal Logics**, including automata-theoretic and game-theoretic approach in Formal Verification.
- **Normative Systems**, including mechanism and multi-agent system design.

Below, a list of textbooks to get a more detailed view on these topics:

 - [Reasoning about Knowledge](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262562003/reasoning-about-knowledge/) \[Fagin, Moses, Halpern, Vardi, 1995\]
 - [Languages Automata and Logic](https://www.irif.fr/~serre/Files/thomas96_handbook.pdf) \[Thomas, 1996\] (**Free access**)
 - [Infinite Words](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/infinite-words/perrin/978-0-12-532111-2) \[Perrin, Pin, 2002\]
 - [An Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.wiley.com/en-be/An+Introduction+to+MultiAgent+Systems%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470519462) \[Wooldridge, 2002\]
 - [Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) \[Norvig, Russell, 2016\]
 - [Games on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10546) \[Fijalkow, 2023\] (**Free access**)

Also, check my [publications](/publications) to find topics of your interest.

#### Bachelor Theses

Due to the **theoretical nature of the topics**, which are typically **not covered** in the undergraduate programmes (both Informatica and ACSAI), I do not recommend taking these subjects for a possible bachelor thesis. However, exceptions are possible if you show a strong interest in the subject.

#### Approach policy

Before contacting me for a possible thesis supervision, please make sure of the following:

- You have **no more than 2 exams left to take** before graduation;
- You have consulted at least one of the *textbooks listed above*, to have a clear idea of the type of work you are going/willing to take. Notice that the last reference is access free;
- *desirable but not mandatory* You already have an idea for a topic.
- Notice that I do **not** work in Machine Learning. Please, take a look at the reference list above before contacting me about possible these.
