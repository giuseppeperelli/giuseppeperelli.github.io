### **Autonomous and Self-Governing Agent-Based Rule Design**

Advancements in self-driving vehicles, smart factories, multi-robot systems in logistics, distributed computing, and financial technology profoundly impact individuals and society. Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) play a pivotal role in modeling and reasoning about these complex systems.

In safety-critical domains like healthcare, computer security, and advanced manufacturing, ensuring the correct behavior of MAS is of utmost importance. However, the current design and adjustment techniques regarding efficiency and quality remain sub-optimal. These methods are often handled manually on a case-by-case basis and lack full understanding and systematization.

This project aims to develop a comprehensive theory and computational tools for the automated production of just rules that guide MAS designers toward correct system specification and behavior. Leveraging remarkable discoveries in Rational Synthesis, Strategic Reasoning, and their connections with Verification and Synthesis in Formal Methods, we pursue a novel scientific direction and potential breakthrough in automating rule-making mechanisms. By advancing the theory and practice of multi-agent systems, we aim to impact cutting-edge technologies based on these powerful models.

The outcome of this project will enable the realization of self-governing mechanisms for the accurate design and implementation of behavioral rules in Multi-Agent Systems. These advancements will significantly influence the practice of designing networks and intelligent systems across contiguous research areas, including planning, robotics, and process management.
